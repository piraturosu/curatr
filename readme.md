# ðŸŽ¨ Curatr

Curatr is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that allows users to search museum and university art collections, filter artworks, and curate their own virtual exhibitions.
It is designed to work seamlessly across devices, supports offline caching, and can be installed on mobile and desktop for a native app-like experience.

This project was created as part of a Digital Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering.
